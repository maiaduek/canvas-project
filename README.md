The authorities at Ironlake are asking the public for their help! Mallard ducks have taken over and have been deemed an aggressive and invasive species attacking civilians, their pets and causing harm to the ecosystem. 
The Mayor of Ironville has not only welcomed hunters to help with the duck problem, but has even offered rewards to those who shoot ducks! 

You're going to see many ducks today of different sizes. The reward goes up per the size of the duck. As a hunter, whenever you see a duck, make sure to shoot it quickly! If you miss too many ducks, its game over. 
Good luck and remember - the bigger the duck you shoot, the bigger the loot!
